We will explore the basics of creating a Hardhat project with a sample contract, tests of that contract, and a script to deploy it.

To create the sample project, run npx hardhat in your project folder:

$ npx hardhat
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888
888    888                      888 888               888

üë∑ Welcome to Hardhat v2.9.9 üë∑‚Äç

? What do you want to do? ‚Ä¶
‚ùØ Create a JavaScript project
  Create a TypeScript project
  Create an empty hardhat.config.js
  Quit
Let‚Äôs create the JavaScript or TypeScript project and go through these steps to compile, test and deploy the sample contract. We recommend using TypeScript, but if you are not familiar with it just pick JavaScript.

The list of available tasks includes the built-in ones and also those that came with any installed plugins. npx hardhat is your starting point to find out what tasks are available to run.

#Compiling your contracts
Next, if you take a look in the contracts/ folder, you'll see Lock.sol:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

// Import this file to use console.log
import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract Lock {
    uint public unlockTime;
    address payable public owner;

    event Withdrawal(uint amount, uint when);

    constructor(uint _unlockTime) payable {
        require(
            block.timestamp < _unlockTime,
            "Unlock time should be in the future"
        );

        unlockTime = _unlockTime;
        owner = payable(msg.sender);
    }

    function withdraw() public {
        // Uncomment this line to print a log in your terminal
        // console.log("Unlock time is %o and block timestamp is %o", unlockTime, block.timestamp);

        require(block.timestamp >= unlockTime, "You can't withdraw yet");
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You aren't the owner");

        emit Withdrawal(address(this).balance, block.timestamp);

        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}

To compile it, simply run:

npx hardhat compile
If you created a TypeScript project, this task will also generate TypeScript bindings using TypeChain.

#Testing your contracts
Your project comes with tests that use Mocha, Chai, and Ethers.js.

If you take a look in the test/ folder, you'll see a test file:
